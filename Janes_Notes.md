# Interleaving Reads
Last week I submitted my first job, which was to interleave the two data files with forward and reverse reads. Each of the data files, from the cultured thermophiles are 26 Gb.

Software used to interleave Cen13_05102014Pooled_ctDNA_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.fastq and Cen13_05102014Pooled_ctDNA_GCCAAT_L002_R2_001.fastq:
khmer

Job script for interleave:
'''
#! /bin/bash

#PBS -l walltime=8:00:00
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l mem=100 Gb
#PBS -e /mnt/ls15/scratch/users/f0002184/
#PBS -o /mnt/ls15/scratch/users/f0002184/
#PBS -N Interleave_Reads
#PBS -M jlee4946@gmail.com
#PBS -m abe

module load GNU/4.8.2
module load khmer/2.0
cd /mnt/ls15/scratch/users/f0002184/
interleave-reads.py Cen13_05102014Pooled_ctDNA_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.fastq Cen13_05102014Pooled_ctDNA_GCCAAT_L002_R2_001.fastq -o combined_reads.fastq
'''

The results were one file, named combined_reads.fastq with 51 Gb.
